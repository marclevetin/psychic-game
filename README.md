# psychic-game
This is Trilogy Ed homework: psychic game.  It's an experiment written in vanilla JavaScript.  I'm providing this repo for a class demonstration of what an acceptable homework submission looks like.  Feel free to do more or less as you see fit.

## rules and requirements
1. The app randomly picks a letter, and the user has to guess which letter the app chose. Put the following text on your page:

2. Guess what letter I'm thinking of t

3. Wins: (# of times the user has guessed the letter correctly)

4. Losses: (# of times the user has failed to guess the letter correctly after exhausting all guesses)

5. Guesses Left: (# of guesses left. This will update)

6. Your Guesses So Far: (the specific letters that the user typed. Display these until the user either wins or loses.)

7. When the player wins, increase the Wins counter and start the game over again (without refreshing the page).

8. When the player loses, increase the Losses counter and restart the game without a page refresh (just like when the user wins).

## installation instructions
1.  clone the repo

2.  open index.html

3.  enjoy!
